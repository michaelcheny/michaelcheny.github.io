1. Sinatra and this project (why i choose my idea)
2. Setting things up and routing (typos and typos)
3. validations and showing error codes
4. Debugging and learning a lot
5. reading the documentation before stack overflow (insert that funny meme)
5. Building good habits through this project (git commits non stop, good commit messages, etc)
6. BRB


Sinatra is a very powerful open sourced web application library that uses the rack web server interface.
