(WORK IN PROGRESS)


Blog for my rail's project. Task Tracker / Goal Tracker with a spicy kick to it. Turn you life into a rpg game.


This rails project was a great learning experience. The entire process felt like a wild rollercoaster ride, with many ups and downs. I started off very confident because rails looked very similar to sinatra, but in a organized and powerful framework. The power of rails blew me away, with all the helpers, and methods to build a working, restful, application in a short amount of time. 


To Be Continued in the morning!
